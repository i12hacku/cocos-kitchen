		<p>Dragon Heritage The Dragon story dates back to 1942, when a family of Chinese immigrants made their way to our island ‘Ceylon’ after days at sea. The new island with the spice-strong cuisine welcomed them with open arms, but these settlers who craved their comfort food from home, found the island flavours interesting, yet lacking in the tastes and textures their hearts craved for.<br>Driven by their entrepreneurial spirit, these settlers found the perfect marriage between the local island cuisine and their authentic palate, cooking up a storm that was soon in demand by locals and other settlers alike.</p>

	<h1>Our Mission</h1>

<section class="content">
	<div class="text-container">
		<p>While the Battle of Ceylon raged on, a battle in the kitchen ensued in a humble space in the old Commercial Building down Galle Road; the outcome of which is known as Chinese Dragon Café today.<br> The Café grew and stood salient through the years whilst history unfolded in Sri Lanka. Through the battles and independence, through wars and pandemics, Chinese Dragon Café has been a staple in Sri Lankan food culture; and is today the oldest and most respected restaurant chain in the country.</p>
